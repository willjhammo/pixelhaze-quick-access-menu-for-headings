A popup menu that automatically takes a user to heading of their choice.

2. Clicking on a menu item smoothly scrolls to the corresponding heading.
3. Easily adjust colors, fonts, and styles via CSS.
4. Users can toggle the menu visibility with a button.

Installation:
1. Add the CSS and customise the appearance of the fixed menu, button, and list items by modifying the provided CSS code. Paste this CSS into the Custom CSS section of your Squarespace site.
2. Ensure the jQuery library is included by adding the following code to the Header section in Settings > Advanced > Code Injection
3. Paste the provided JavaScript code into the Footer section of Code Injection settings. This script initialises the plugin, dynamically builds the heading menu, and adds smooth scrolling functionality.
